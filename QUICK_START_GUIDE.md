## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Track Progress Automatically
Set milestone progress (0-100%) to automatically visualize completion in the dashboard.

### 2. Monitor Budget Utilization
The system automatically calculates:
- Remaining amount = Total - Spent
- Utilization rate = (Spent / Total) √ó 100

### 3. Use Directorate Filtering
Link projects to directorates to get departmental performance metrics.

### 4. Leverage Trends
Use the 6-month trend data to identify patterns and make informed decisions.

### 5. Archive vs Delete
Use archive instead of delete to maintain history and audit trails.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Loading?
Check permissions: User must have `view projects` permission.

### Can't Create Milestone/Budget?
Check permissions: User needs `create project` permission.

### API Returns 401?
Ensure you're authenticated via Sanctum token or session.

### Trends Not Showing?
Create some historical data first. Trends require at least one month of data.
