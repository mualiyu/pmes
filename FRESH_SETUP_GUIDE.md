3. **Check Admin Dashboard** - Should show all statistics
4. **Check Monitoring Dashboard** - Should show milestones and budgets
5. **Navigate to Projects** - Should see both projects
6. **Open a project** - Should see milestones, budgets, and indicators

## Troubleshooting

### "Seed demo data?" not appearing
Make sure you're running `migrate:fresh --seed` or `migrate --seed`

### Permission errors
Run:
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

### Database connection errors
Check your `.env` file for correct database credentials:
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=pmes
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Roles not working
Ensure the migration and seeder ran successfully:
```bash
php artisan migrate:status
```

## Next Steps

1. **Customize** the owner company info in Settings â†’ Company
2. **Add more users** as needed
3. **Create additional projects**
4. **Explore dashboards** to see system capabilities
5. **Test different roles** by logging in with different accounts

## Production Setup

For production deployment, answer **no** when asked to seed demo data. This will:
- Create only the system administrator account
- Create basic labels and system data
- Skip demo projects and organizations

**Ready to start!** ðŸš€

Run: `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` and answer **yes** to seed demo data.
